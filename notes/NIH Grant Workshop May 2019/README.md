# NIH Grant Workshop May 2019
------------------------------

### CSR: Center of Scientific Review
 * 1st level of review with CSR Study Section or (in some cases) an institutional review panel
   * Measure the scientific merit of an application
 * 2nd level of review with the funding institute (like NIMH, NINDS etc.)

 3 Annual Cycles of Application Review: [link](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/due-dates-and-submission-policies/due-dates.htm)

### Preparing Applications:

 * Read the Instructions [link](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide.html)
 * Never assume reviewers know what you know
 * Refer to pertinent literature
   * better to highlight your own publications or preliminary data
 * **DON'T** overstate the significance of your research
 * Seek out mentor colleagues. An unbiased look helps out
 * **Clearly state the rationale**
 * Include well-designed figures and tables
 * Organized and lucid writing
 * **DON'T** be overly ambitious 
 * (Disclaimer: Not sure if I heard correctly) consider a "rigor of prior research" section in the application

#### Common Pitfalls:

 * Use the correct form!
 * Overstuffing
   * do not put text that belongs in the research strategy in the biological agents (or other required sections without page limits).
   * i.e. Respect the page-limits. The reviewers are not allowed to consider research strategy if it's in the wrong section. 
 * Submitting a new application but referring to previous review outcomes or criticism
   * unless: A1 application (which is a re-submission of an unfunded application)

#### Finding a Funding Opportunity (FOA):

 Useful Links:

 * [NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts](https://grants.nih.gov/funding/searchguide/index.html#/)
 * [NIH Reporter Advanced Search](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/)
   * NIH Reporter is helpful:
     * Easy to find FOA and PO.
     * Show what study sections funded grants went to
     * **[Match Maker](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter_matchmaker.cfm?source=RPCO&new=1) to find related funded applications**
       * Just paste in abstract or specific aims!

 * Contact a Program Officer (PO) of FOA to help guide 

 * Use [Assisted Referral Tool](https://art.csr.nih.gov/ART/) to help find a study section
   * Just paste in abstract or specific aims.

#### Study Sections: CSR

 * Integrated Review Groups typically have broad topics like "Immunology"
  * [list of IRGs](https://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/IntegratedReviewGroups)

![IRGs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dantaki/presentations/master/notes/NIH%20Grant%20Workshop%20May%202019/Screenshot_2019-05-13_16-39-15.png)

 * Integrated Review Groups contains many specific study sections
 * Helps identify which study section an application is sent to

 * Example: [Genes, Genomes and Genetics IRG: GGG](https://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/DBIB/GGG)
   * GGG Study Sections
     * Molecular Genetics A Study Section (MGA)
     * Molecular Genetics B Study Sections
     * and so on... 

   * Take a look at [MGA](https://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/DBIB/GGG/MGA) which contains the following information:
     * Broad description and topics
     * Shared Interests and Overlaps with other study sections
       * **NOTE**: this is useful when you are unsure about a specific study section or it's permanent members
     * Permanent Member: [found under the "Membership Panel"](https://public.era.nih.gov/pubroster/jsp/roster.jsp?CID=102586)
     * Ad-hoc Members and their review dates, under "Review Dates"

 * **To get a "real flavor" of a study section, take a look at the membership panel and funded grants**

#### Cover Letter

  * Use the Assignment Request Form (ARF) for a request of a study section (not the case for fellowships)
  *
