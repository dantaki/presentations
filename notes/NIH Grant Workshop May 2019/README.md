# NIH Grant Workshop May 2019
------------------------------

### CSR: Center of Scientific Review
 * 1st level of review with CSR Study Section or (in some cases) an institutional review panel
   * Measure the scientific merit of an application
 * 2nd level of review with the funding institute (like NIMH, NINDS etc.)

 3 Annual Cycles of Application Review: [link](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/due-dates-and-submission-policies/due-dates.htm)

### Preparing Applications:

 * Read the Instructions [link](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide.html)
 * Never assume reviewers know what you know
 * Refer to pertinent literature
   * better to highlight your own publications or preliminary data
 * **DON'T** overstate the significance of your research
 * Seek out mentor colleagues. An unbiased look helps out
 * **Clearly state the rationale**
 * Include well-designed figures and tables
 * Organized and lucid writing
 * **DON'T** be overly ambitious 
 * (Disclaimer: Not sure if I heard correctly) consider a "rigor of prior research" section in the application

#### Common Pitfalls:

 * Use the correct form!
 * Overstuffing
   * do not put text that belongs in the research strategy in the biological agents (or other required sections without page limits).
   * i.e. Respect the page-limits. The reviewers are not allowed to consider research strategy if it's in the wrong section. 
 * Submitting a new application but referring to previous review outcomes or criticism
   * unless: A1 application (which is a re-submission of an unfunded application)

#### Finding a Funding Opportunity (FOA):

 Useful Links:

 * [NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts](https://grants.nih.gov/funding/searchguide/index.html#/)
 * [NIH Reporter Advanced Search](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/)
   * NIH Reporter is helpful:
     * Easy to find FOA and PO.
     * Show what study sections funded grants went to
     * **[Match Maker](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter_matchmaker.cfm?source=RPCO&new=1) to find related funded applications**
       * Just paste in abstract or specific aims!

 * Contact a Program Officer (PO) of FOA to help guide 

 * Use [Assisted Referral Tool](https://art.csr.nih.gov/ART/) to help find a study section
   * Just paste in abstract or specific aims.

#### Study Sections: CSR

 * Integrated Review Groups typically have broad topics like "Immunology"
  * [list of IRGs](https://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/IntegratedReviewGroups)

![IRGs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dantaki/presentations/master/notes/NIH%20Grant%20Workshop%20May%202019/Screenshot_2019-05-13_16-39-15.png)

 * Integrated Review Groups contains many specific study sections
 * Helps identify which study section an application is sent to

 * Example: [Genes, Genomes and Genetics IRG: GGG](https://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/DBIB/GGG)
   * GGG Study Sections
     * Molecular Genetics A Study Section (MGA)
     * Molecular Genetics B Study Sections
     * and so on... 

   * Take a look at [MGA](https://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections/DBIB/GGG/MGA) which contains the following information:
     * Broad description and topics
     * Shared Interests and Overlaps with other study sections
       * **NOTE**: this is useful when you are unsure about a specific study section or it's permanent members
     * Permanent Member: [found under the "Membership Panel"](https://public.era.nih.gov/pubroster/jsp/roster.jsp?CID=102586)
     * Ad-hoc Members and their review dates, under "Review Dates"

 * **To get a "real flavor" of a study section, take a look at the membership panel and funded grants**

#### Cover Letter

 * Use the Assignment Request Form (ARF) for a request of a study section (not the case for fellowships)
 * **DO NOT** ask for reviewers by name.
   * This will disqualify your application

#### What Reviewers Look For:
 * Significance
 * Exciting Ideas
 * Clarity
 * Realistic Timelines
 * Brevity in Common Knowledge

-----------------------------

### Program Officer Duties & Funding Mechanisms and Opportunities

 * Program Officer (PO) provide expertise and find gaps and write funding opportunities

 * **POs are your advocate inside the NIH**
   * Talk with POs to get information and help about funding opportunities

#### Funding Opportunities 

 * Request for Applications (RFA)
  * customized, always has funding
  * set funds for one-time application

 * Program Annoucement (PA)
  * No funds sets
  * Seeking more applications for a given topic
    * PAR: review group attached to PA
    * PAS: **set-aside funding**

 * "Notice of Special Interest"
   * typically these FOAs direct towards parent FOA 

 * CSR Reviews nearly all
   * R01, R03, R21
   * F- training grants
   * AREA/R15
 * Institute will review
   * T/K training grants
   * **K22/99** transition awards

 * There is a trend in some institutes to fund more R21s instead of R01s
   * Speak to a PO about options for R21 vs. R01
   * Consider delaying R01 since new investigators have a lower threshold for funding
   * Once R01 is awarded the investigator loses "new" status

 * Search for a **"Payline"** within an institute to see percentile thresholds for funding
 * Consider the payline of many institutes if your research is cross disciplinary
   * **different institutes have different scoring thresholds for new vs. established investigators**

 * Consider **"Concepts"** an institute will publish
  * potential initiatives / gaps in a field
  * Help approve borderline grants
  * The institute intends to write a FOA but no funds are allocated yet
  * Each institute has a council meeting where concepts are drawn out. This is public. 

#### Grant Writing

 * **DO NOT** make it incremental
 * Move field forward but ensure experimental approach is feasible
 * Be risk-adverse for most fellowships
 * Recruit people with experience you may lack

------------------------

## Review Criteria

 * CSR: preliminary overall score with written critique
 * 5 core review criteria (each scored 1-9; 1 being the best)
  * Significance
  * Investigator 
  * Innovation
  * Approach 
  * Environment
 * Then the application is scored for overall impact from 1-9
  * *how best research moves field in meaningful way*

#### Rigor of Research

 * 2 important considerations for applications
 * Rigor of Prior Research
   * Used to be called "premise"
   * Belongs in "Significance" and "Approach" sections
   * Personal publications and relevant literature
   * Preliminary findings
 * Rigor of Scientific Research
   * Methods and Approach
   * Belongs in "Approach" section

#### Significance

 * Application is concerned with an important problem
 * Aims are achievable
 * Rigor of Prior Research
   * "the prior research that serves as the key support for a proposed work"
   * include literature to build hypothesis on.
   * your own literature

#### Approach
 
 * Methodologies
 * Week reasoned
 * Robust 
 * Unbiased
 * Carefully think about potential problems and alternative approaches

 * Preliminary Data
   * important to be rigorous 
   * include relevant statistics
     * subject / animal number
   * same factors still hold true for proposed research

 * Inclusion of Women and Minorities
   * NIH requires subjects (human and other vertebrates) to include representatives of both genders
     * Unless the research requires one gender (i.e. sperm analysis). Clearly indicate why one gender was omitted
   * For human studies, inclusion of minorities is required, if not clearly explain rationale for exclusion

 * Biohazards
   * Impacts total score if not included 
   * How certain compounds are handled

 * Authentication of Key Biological Agents
   * Genetically modified organisms
   * Antibodies 
   * Cell lines

   * Not enough to mention "trued vendors"
   * Provide description of techniques of validation (i.e. genotyping)

   * This is important for NIH since many failed proposals was due to failure of validation

#### [CSR Videos on Peer Review Process](https://public.csr.nih.gov/NewsAndPolicy/PeerReviewVideos)

 * After Review contact PO 
   * Interpreting results of review
   * Get their opinion
   * Provide an idea of what the score means.
